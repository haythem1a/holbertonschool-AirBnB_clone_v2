# Description ðŸ’¬
A web framework is a structured software platform designed to simplify the development of dynamic websites and web applications. It provides pre-built tools, libraries, and conventions that streamline tasks such as routing URLs, managing databases, handling user sessions, and implementing security features. By offering these components, a web framework accelerates development, promotes code reusability, and ensures adherence to best practices. Developers can focus more on creating specific functionality rather than dealing with common infrastructure concerns. Examples include Django in Python, Ruby on Rails in Ruby, Express in JavaScript, and Laravel in PHP. Each framework offers unique features catering to different programming languages and application needs.
